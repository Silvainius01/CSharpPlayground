Desires:

Player chooses a theme, and the game enforces that choice. 
	- Follow a skill tree
	- The PC can still grind out all skills, but specialization bonuses are limited are better used in a single area.
Player should be slowly exposed to the magic overtime, limitng information overload. 
	- Add an option to reveal everything for advanced/experienced players.
Spell Creation ala Morrowind
	- Can create new spells from a list of known effects.
All spells belong to a school:
	- Kinomancy (needs better name?)
		- Elemental magic. Often deals with the manipulation of physical objects or forces.
		- Telekinesis, lightning bolt, fireball, water manipulation, active camo (lesser invisibility), sound manipulation, etc.
		- Kineticists subdivide into elemets:
			- Fire, Water, Earth, Air
	- Biomancy
		- The magic of the living. Deals with diseases, toxins, and body manipulation. Both good and ill. 
		- Healing spells, poison spells, breaking or twisting limbs. Limited illusion capabilites by directly affecting the mind's structure or chemistry. Half of the necromancy equation
	- Astromancy
		- Space and time manipulation, astral magic often accomplishes its goals indirectly.
		- Slow down or speed up time, speed manipulation, teleportation, create true vacuums, gravity manipulation, etc.
	- Arcomancy
		- True magic, the power of the gods themselves. 
		- Mage armor, clairvoyance, eldritch blast, external illusions, object creation, the other half of necromancy etc.
		- Becoming knowledgable in Arcomancy will unlock more powerful spells and abilities in the other schools (doesnt require spec points)
