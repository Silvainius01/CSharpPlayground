Weapons have three tiers to understand: governing attribute(s), general skill, specific skill.

	Each weapon has two governing attributes, major and minor. Major attributes generally preside over your ability to deal damage with that weapon, and determine your general ability to wield it.
The minor attribute provide smaller boosts to your effectivness, usually in the form of hit chance, but can offer smaller benefits as well.
	Beyond this, weapons also have a general skill assoiciated with them. This "general skill" reflects your overall competence at using the kind of weapon it is. 
A master of the blade has working knowledge that can be transferred from dagger to claymore to rapier.
	Which leads us to specific skill. Each weapon has its own skill value that represents your sepcific training and familliarity of that weapon. 
The aforementiond master of the blade might know how blades work and the idea behind how a given weapon is meant to operate, but they will still lack the training, muscle memory, and/or conditioning to effectively weild it.
	Specific weapons might also have additional attribute requirements to satisfy. Such weapons are typically highly specialized for certain scenarios, and generally lack versatility the normal adventurer requires.

Whenever you gain a point in a weapon skill, you also gain a point in that general skill as well.

General Skills [MAJOR/MINOR]:
	Axe		[STR, DEX]
	Blade	[DEX, STR]
	Blunt	[STR, CON]
	Ranged	[DEX, WIS]
	Spear	[DEX, CON]

TO_HIT:
	baseChance = 0.01 * ((genSkill/2)+specSkill); // Up to 150% base chance 
	realChance = baseChance * (majAttrPercent+(minAttrPercent/2)) * (0.5+fatiguePercent)
	max				= 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 337.5%
	fatiguedMax		= 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.5 = 112.5%
	minSkill100		= 0.45 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 101.25% (30 general, 30 specific)
	minFatigue100	= 1.34 * 1.5 * 0.5 = 100.5%  (90 general, 90 specific)

Fatigue Cost
	Weapons cost fatigue to swing, the exact amount depends on how much they weigh.
	If you meet the stat requirements, cost = weight. More stats means less fatigue, less stats means more. Up to 1000x more.
	Cost = (weight * 2) / Max(pMajAttr*1.5 + pMinAttr*0.5, 0.001);

Skill Bonus
	The skill bonus is complex, but here is the formula:
		(1.014 / 1+e^(-.1x+5)) - 0.007
		Where x = Floor(specSkill*0.75 + genSkill/4)
	This provides 0-100% bonus depending on overall competence with the weapon.

Unarmed
	For hand-to-hand giga-chads, fists are linked to the Blunt general weapon skill.
	There do exist "fist weapons" that count toward unarmed, but your bare fists can be just as deadly.

Damage
	Every weapon gets a damage bonus based on their major attribute.
	The two exceptions are Ranged weapons, and hand-to-hand, which get bonus damage from WIS instead. 
	(baseDamage+(majAttr/2)+(minAttr/4)) 
	* materialBonus 
	* (quality / (1.4-skillBonus)) // Ski


Evasion
	baseChance = 0.01 * ( (evasion * 0.75) + (unarmored/4) ) // Max 100
	realChance = baseChance * (pDEX+(pWIS/2)) * (0.25+fatiguePercent) // 1*1.5*1.25 = 187.5% at max skill

Weapon Quality
	Weapon Quality is a subtle but extremely important stat that affects its performance in indirect ways.
	High quality weapons deal more damage the higher your skill with it is.
	High quality weapons are easier to enchant, and can hold more powerful enchantments.
	High quality weapons have better durablity, and can withstand more abuse.
	Quality Levels:
		x < 1.0 = Low
		1 <= x < 2 = Average
		2 <= x < 3 = High
		3 <= x < 4 = Renowned
		x > 4 = Legendary

Weapon Durability
	Weapons have a durablity stat, which decreases with use.
	A weapon will deal less damage as it degrades. This decline isnt notable at first, but once a certain threshold is crossed it'll plummit very quickly.
	When a weapon breaks, it *cannot* be repaired, only metled down to reclaim some material.

Weapon Enchantments
	Enchantments come in three flavors: Passive, Active, and Hybrid
	Like all magic, enchantments consume mana. Just like creatures, enchanted weapon has an internal mana pool that it can draw from.
	A weapon's mana pool slowly regenerates over time as it absorbs it from the enviornment, but can be manually infused from any source if you have the means to tap it.
	Enchantment Types:
		- Passive enchantments are generally weak, and drain mana at a constant rate. This typically, but not neccessarily, limits them to the natual absorbtion rate of the weapon.
		- Innate ecchantments are a special class of passive enchantment. They are enchantments that are imbued into a weapon as a part of the forging process, and are poorly understood.
		  These enchantments are often benign, producing largely cosmetic effects that dont affect the effectiveness of the weapon, but due to their nature, can still provide practical use.
		  An example of an innate enchantment would be Sting and Glamdring from LotR, where the a specific elven kingdom of old hated Orcs so vehemetly that their weapons shine blue when they are nearby. 
		- Active enchantments operate much like spells, they consume X amount of mana all at once to produce an effect.
		- Hybrid enchantments are the most common, and blend the two types, a typical example being a damage enchantment that has a passive base effect, and an active burst.
			- In world, hybrid enchantments are explained as a "weave", where two enchantments are woven together into a more effiecient, bonded pair. But as a mechanic, it is functionally a third type.

Divine Weapons
	Divine weapons are artifacts created, forged, blessed, or inhabited by a god.
	These weapons can be of any quality, but are generally more powerful than even the best mortal blades.
	Their divine nature causes them to attune to their weilder in ways mortal magics cannot, allowing them to scale over time.
