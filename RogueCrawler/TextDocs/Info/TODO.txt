- Finish Martial Weapon System!!
	- Implement remaining character systems
		- Fatigue
			- Figure out costs
	- Add weapon durability
		- Durability determined by material and quality.
			- Base * material * quality?
		- Durability decreases as you use weapon
			- Being skilled adds minor multiplier that slows wear (proper use and all that)
			- Hits reduce faster than misses
				- Hitting certain materials will damage the weapon faster
					- Blades hitting armor will dull them faster, for example.
			- Add way to repair
				- Spending money at a blacksmith after a dungeon probs
	- Review weapon damage formula. Starting to look a bit wack.
	- Review how attributes affect weapons
		- Current system that gives levels to weapons is fun, but prevents character experimentation.

- Update dungeon generation
	- Allow inaccessible rooms to make the layout more interesting.

- Implement magic (oh god this will be hard af)
	- Implement character systems
		- Mana
	- First, gotta fkn design the damn system. 
		- Based on/Inspired by Morrowind's spell system. Because imo it was the pinnacle of spellcrafting.
		- Spells have levels just like weapons?
			- More powerful spells require more attribute points to cast.
			- Spells below or equal to your ability always cast successfully at their displayed power.
			- Spells above your level have a chance to fail and:
				- Be cast at x% less power
				- Fail completely
				- Backfire
		- Spell power determined by stats?
			- A fire spell will do X fire damage, a more powerful mage can pump more power into the spell.
			- Can also affect magnitude of the spell by how much MP you pump into it

- Probably gonna end up porting most of this to Unity. Or something.
	- this will mean doing the procedural generation from scratch. Time to rewrite my tile system.
