Attributes: STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA LCK

Weapons have three tiers to understand: governing attribute(s), general skill, specific skill.

	Each weapon has two governing attributes, major and minor. Major attributes generally preside over your ability to deal damage with that weapon, and determine your general ability to wield it.
The minor attribute provide smaller boosts to your effectivness, usually in the form of hit chance, but can offer smaller benefits as well.
	Beyond this, weapons also have a general skill assoiciated with them. This "general skill" reflects your overall competence at using the kind of weapon it is. 
A master of the blade has working knowledge that can be transferred from dagger to claymore to rapier.
	Which leads us to specific skill. Each weapon has its own skill value that represents your sepcific training and familliarity of that weapon. 
The aforementiond master of the blade might know how blades work and the idea behind how a given weapon is meant to operate, but they will still lack the training, muscle memory, and/or conditioning to effectively weild it.
	Specific weapons might also have additional attribute requirements to satisfy. Such weapons are typically highly specialized for certain scenarios, and generally lack versatility the normal adventurer requires.

Whenever you gain a point in a weapon skill, you also gain a point in that general skill as well.

General Skills [MAJOR/MINOR]:
	Axe		[STR, DEX]
	Blade	[DEX, STR]
	Blunt	[STR, CON]
	Ranged	[DEX, WIS]
	Spear	[DEX, CON]

TO_HIT:
	baseChance = 0.01 * ((genSkill/2)+specSkill); // Up to 150% base chance 
	realChance = baseChance * (majAttrPercent+(minAttrPercent/2)) * (0.5+fatiguePercent)
	max				= 1.5 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 337.5%
	fatiguedMax		= 1.5 * 1.5 * 0.5 = 112.5%
	minSkill100		= 0.45 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 101.25 (30 general, 30 specific)
	minFatigue100	= 1.34 * 1.5 * 0.5 = 100.5% (90 general, 90 specific)

Unarmed
	For hand-to-hand giga-chads, fists are linked to the Blunt general weapon skill.
	There do exist "fist weapons" that count toward unarmed, but your bare fists can be just as deadly.

Damage
	Every weapon gets a damage bonus based on their major attribute.
	The two exceptions are Ranged weapons, and hand-to-hand, which get bonus damage from WIS instead. 

Evasion
	baseChance = 0.01 * ( (evasion/4*3) + (unarmored/4) )
	realChance = baseChance * (pDEX+(pWIS/2)) * (0.25+fatiguePercent)
